# Space Salaryman
This is a game that me and three others made during NUS Gamecraft 2018. The theme of this game jam was "clockwork", and hence the concept of a game where you play the role of a salary man, doing menial tasks over and over again, like clockwork. Play the latest version of the game [here](https://zioul123.github.io/SpaceSalaryManHosting/Submission/), and view the source code of the game (very messy, as it's a 24h game jam, admittedly there's a lot of bad coding practices in there) [here](https://github.com/SusterDrifter/gamejam-2018/).

This was the planning page for our project:

        - block everything since you cant see
        - Drag a (number of) circuit breaker switch

# Brainstorming
## Game Idea

- rhythm game
- superhot
- compulsive disorder
- habits
- building with parts/gears

- repetitive task + multitasking the game
- forced turn based game
 
-> every successful clock cycle -> something bad happens
-> you need to delay the clock cycle before it starts
-> while completing the objectives of the game

-> you running a workshop, it is breaking down (got fire, got stuff)
-> you need to fix stuff, each stuff have their own cycle
-> can pause 
-> habitual thing u need to do : water thingy

    - What is it about?
        - Space Salary Man goes about his daily job saving the world through one menial task at a time.
        - We interpreted the meaning of clockwork as habitual habits that a person must go through, and made it into the main game mechanics. The player needs to juggle between his tasks like clockwork.
